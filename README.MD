# SandBank - .NET Core 3.1 + Vue.js banking sandbox

This is a sandbox implementation of a bank originally built as a core piece of infrastructure for a FinTech hackathon about Open Banking. I have since continued to develop it as a platform for learning new technologies, system architecture and infrastructure as code.
